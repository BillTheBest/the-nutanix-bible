<p>I am honored to write a foreword for this book that we've come to call "The Nutanix Bible." First and foremost, let me address the name of the book, which to some would seem not fully inclusive vis-à-vis their own faiths, or to others who are agnostic or atheist. There is a Merriam Webster meaning of the word "bible" that is not literally about scriptures: "a publication that is preeminent especially in authoritativeness or wide readership". And that is how you should interpret its roots. It started being written by one of the most humble yet knowledgeable employees at Nutanix, Steven Poitras, our first Solution Architect who continues to be authoritative on the subject without wielding his "early employee" primogeniture. Knowledge to him was not power -- the act of sharing that knowledge is what makes him eminently powerful in this company. Steve epitomizes culture in this company -- by helping everyone else out with his authority on the subject, by helping them automate their chores in Power Shell or Python, by building insightful reference architectures (that are beautifully balanced in both content and form), by being a real-time buddy to anyone needing help on Yammer or Twitter, by being transparent with engineers on the need to self-reflect and self-improve, and by being ambitious.</p>

<p>When he came forward to write a blog, his big dream was to lead with transparency, and to build advocates in the field who would be empowered to make design trade-offs based on this transparency. It is rare for companies to open up on design and architecture as much as Steve has with his blog. Most open source companies -- who at the surface might seem transparent because their code is open source -- never talk in-depth about design, and "how it works" under the hood. When our competitors know about our product or design weaknesses, it makes us stronger -- because there is very little to hide, and everything to gain when something gets critiqued under a crosshair. A public admonition of a feature trade-off or a design decision drives the entire company on Yammer in quick time, and before long, we've a conclusion on whether it is a genuine weakness or a true strength that someone is fear-mongering on. Nutanix Bible, in essence, protects us from drinking our own kool aid. That is the power of an honest discourse with our customers and partners.</p>

<p>This ever-improving artifact, beyond being authoritative, is also enjoying wide readership across the world. Architects, managers, and CIOs alike, have stopped me in conference hallways to talk about how refreshingly lucid the writing style is, with some painfully detailed illustrations, visio diagrams, and pictorials. Steve has taken time to tell the web-scale story, without taking shortcuts. Democratizing our distributed architecture was not going to be easy in a world where most IT practitioners have been buried in dealing with the "urgent". The Bible bridges the gap between IT and DevOps, because it attempts to explain computer science and software engineering trade-offs in very simple terms. We hope that in the coming 3-5 years, IT will speak a language that helps them get closer to the DevOps' web-scale jargon.</p>

<p>With this first edition, we are converting Steve's blog into a book. The day we stop adding to this book is the beginning of the end of this company. I expect each and everyone of you to keep reminding us of what brought us this far: truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, will set you free (from complacency and hubris).</p>

<p>Keep us honest.</p>

<p>Users today are constantly barraged by new technologies. There is no limit of new opportunities for IT to change to a "new and better way", but the adoption of new technology and more importantly, the change of operations and processes is difficult. Even the huge growth of open source technologies has been hampered by lack of adequate documentation. Wikibon was founded on the principal that the community can help with this problem and in that spirit, The Nutanix Bible, which started as a blog post by Steve Poitras, has become a valuable reference point for IT practitioners that want to learn about hypercovergence and web-scale principles or to dig deep into Nutanix and hypervisor architectures. The concepts that Steve has written about are advanced software engineering problems that some of the smartest engineers in the industry have designed a solution for. The book explains these technologies in a way that is understandable to IT generalists without compromising the technical veracity.</p>

<p>The concepts of distributed systems and software-led infrastructure are critical for IT practitioners to understand. I encourage both Nutanix customers and everyone who wants to understand these trends to read the book. The technologies discussed here power some of the largest datacenters in the world.</p>

<p>Welcome to The Nutanix Bible!&nbsp; I work with the Nutanix platform on a daily basis – trying to find issues, push its limits as well as administer it for my production benchmarking lab.&nbsp; This item is being produced to serve as a living document outlining tips and tricks used every day by myself and a variety of engineers here at Nutanix.</p>

<p>NOTE: What you see here is an under the covers look at how things work.&nbsp; With that said, all topics discussed are abstracted by Nutanix and knowledge isn't required to successfully operate a Nutanix environment!</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
